/// Simple example of Rust firmware to do real-time audio DSP on
/// a LiteX-created VexRiscV SMP SoC. Assumes a single core.
///
/// This example implements a fixed-point low-pass filter of which
/// you can see the implementation in `dsp.rs`.
///
/// - Uses RISCV-PLIC (platform-level interrupt controller) to
///   claim and handle interrupts. This makes it easy to scale to
///   more cores as SMP VexRISCV only supports PLIC by default.
/// - Static buffers are managed by the 'DMA router' which is a separate
///   LiteX peripheral shuffling data back/forth to eurorack-pmod.
/// - IRQs fire when the buffer is half-full AND full such that the
///   ISR can process audio samples in real-time without glitches.
